# 🚀 28DaysOfGenAI: A Generative AI Learning Series

Welcome to my **#28DaysOfGenAI** GitHub repository — a daily showcase of hands-on learning, experiments, visual storytelling, and real-world application of Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and the emerging **Agentic AI** movement.

## 📌 About This Series

This series is a public commitment to learning, sharing, and simplifying the most powerful technologies transforming our world today — **GenAI**, **LLMs**, **ML**, and now **Agentic AI**.

Each day, I share:
- ✏️ A concise, carousel-style visual post (shared on LinkedIn)
- 🧪 Project notebooks or demos
- 🔁 Code walkthroughs from top creators
- 📚 Curated documentation and self-practice materials

> **Diagram**: This image illustrates the progression from traditional **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Generative AI (GenAI)**, and the emerging paradigm of **Agentic AI**.

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| AI | Algorithms mimicking human intelligence |
| ML | Models learning from data to predict outcomes |
| DL | Neural networks enabling image, voice, and text recognition |
| LLM | Large-scale language models trained on vast data |
| GenAI | AI that *creates* new content: text, images, code, etc. |
| **Agentic AI** | Autonomous agents that plan, reason, and act toward goals |
